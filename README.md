#The main problem that we are solving?
The Deaf and Mute people,
Their world may seem silent but it’s lively, the power of learning 
and knowledge never ceases to resonate.
The very first problem is the suppression of ‘Deaf people’ to raise their 
voices about their academic and social needs. It began in their family and 
this suppression continues throughout their life in schools, colleges, 
communities, and workplaces. The reason being hearing perspective of 
deafness is taken for their education and inclusion in society.
To be very specific, some of the challenges are:
1.  lack of awareness about diversities among deaf people: It is the reason that we 
follow ‘fits all’ approach to render their academic and social needs
2.  Lack of job opportunities: Though at present some private firms are willing to 
hire deaf people but still there is a long way to go ahead (in terms of provision 
to accessibility to information, the attitude of hearing  staff, etc)
3.  Education: Lack of sign language interpreters and teachers who now sign 
language
4.  Inaccessibility to information in public offices and private firms because most of 
the information is available in verbal mode.
5.  Lack of caption or subtitles in TV serials, news (again a barrier to access 
media)

#The importance of this problem?
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 466 million people 
across the world have disabling hearing loss (over 5% of the world’s 
population), of whom 34 million are children.   Statistics released by the 
United Nations also indicate that, in Egypt alone, 7.5 million people suffer 
from deafness or hearing impairment.
Studies expect these numbers to rise to 900 million by 2050.

#The current solutions?
The current solution is sign language is  a language like any other globally 
recognized language. It is a non-verbal means of communication used by 
the deaf and mute to communicate amongst each other and with others. It 
allows people to express themselves and understand each other without 
speaking. 
But, there are a lot of difficulties to learn this language, moreover why 
normal people learn sign language?

#How will our solution solve the problem?
